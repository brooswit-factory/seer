# changelog.d/ — per-PR changelog fragments

Every PR that touches a gated path (`src/`, `schema/`, or `package.json`) must
add exactly one new fragment here: `changelog.d/<TICKET>.md`. One file per PR
means two concurrent PRs never touch the same line of the same file — nothing
to rebase away, no discarded approvals. Do **not** append to a shared
`## [Unreleased]` section instead; that reintroduces the exact conflict this
scheme exists to remove.

The release workflow collates every fragment present on the base branch at
merge time, computes the version from their declared bump levels, writes it
into `package.json` and a dated `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading in
`CHANGELOG.md`, and deletes the fragments it consumed. **Do not** bump
`package.json`'s version or add a dated CHANGELOG heading yourself — the
release gate rejects both.

## Format

```
bump: minor

### Added
- a thing this PR adds

### Fixed
- a bug this PR fixes
```

- First line: `bump: major` / `bump: minor` / `bump: patch`.
- Followed by `### <Section>` blocks (`BREAKING`, `Added`, `Changed`,
  `Fixed`, `Removed`) with `- ` bullets.
- A `### BREAKING` section requires `bump: major`, and `bump: major` requires
  a `### BREAKING` section — the gate checks both directions.
- If your PR changes anything under `schema/`, declare at least `bump: minor`.

A PR with no gated changes needs no fragment.
